/*Data types:  **PRIMARY KEY columns can be used to uniquely identify the row.
**UNIQUE columns have a different value for every row.
This is similar to PRIMARY KEY but a table can have many different UNIQUE columns.
**NOT NULL columns must have a value.

SELECT name AS 'Titles'

AS is a keyword in SQL that allows you to rename a column or table using an alias.
--columns have not been renamed in the table!!! The aliases only appear in the result.

SELECT DISTINCT tools
FROM inventory;
DISTINCT is used to return unique values in the output.
It filters out all duplicate values in the specified column(s).
--doesn't automatically sort (ie year earliest to latest)

select * --all columns
FROM table_name
WHERE (column name) (operator - LIKE - IS NULL - BETWEEN - )
	AND (column name) (operator - LIKE - IS NULL - BETWEEN - ) --combines mult conditions

operators: < > = != >= <=, (WHERE year > 2000;)

LIKE --not case sensitive
_ = wildcard (WHERE name LIKE 'Se_en'; = will return Seven and Se7en
% = wildcard (WHERE name LIKE '%man%;')
'man%' - begin with "man" (Man of Steel)
'%man' - end with "man" (Iron Man, Batman, Rain Man)
'%man%' movies containing word man (Batman, Man of Steel, Spider-Man 2)

IS NULL - unknown/missing values
SELECT name FROM movies WHERE imdb_rating IS NOT NULL;

BETWEEN two letters is not inclusive of the 2nd letter.
BETWEEN two numbers is inclusive of the 2nd number.
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE name BETWEEN 'A' AND 'J';
"A" UP TO BUT NOT INCLUDING "J" (American Sniper, Inside Out)
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 1999;
Includes year 1999!

SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 1999
